### Documentation 

##### Options:

If you don't want these methods added to the window object simply modify the immediate function to pass in the JavaScript object of your choosing.

##### Methods:

- **toRGB** *(`String` color)*

	- summary: 
		- Converts a 6 digit Hexadecimal string value to an RGB integer array. Important! input must be a 6 digit Hexadecimal string "bad" will not convert correctly but "bbaadd" will. To keep the function as light as possible there is no idiot-proofing, if you pass in bad data I'm not fixing it for you :-)
	
	- example:
		- Convert the Hexadecimal value "c0ffee" (a blue color) to RGB integers. The variable "rgb" will be equal to {red: 192,green: 255,blue: 238}

		  ```javascript
		  var rgb = toRGB("c0ffee");
		  //rgb === {red: 192,green: 255,blue: 238}
		  ```

	- color: `String`
		- 6 digit Hexadecimal string value
	
	- returns: `Array`
		- An array containing the RGB integers in the following format [red, green, blue]

- **toHex** *(`Number` red, `Number` green, `Number` blue)*

	- summary:
        - Converts 3 RGB integer values into a 6 digit Hexadecimal string.
        Important! input must be integers with a range of 0 to 255.
        To keep the function as light as possible there is no idiot-proofing,
        if you pass in bad data I'm not fixing it for you :-)

	- example:
		- Convert the RGB values [192, 255, 238] to Hexadecimal string. The variable "hex" will be equal to "c0ffee"

		  ```javascript
		  var hex = toHex(192, 255, 238);
		  //hex === "c0ffee"
		  ```
		  
	- red: `Number`
		- number ranging from 0 to 255 indicating the amount of red

	- green: `Number`
		- number ranging from 0 to 255 indicating the amount of green

	- blue: `Number`
		- number ranging from 0 to 255 indicating the amount of blue

	- returns: `String`
		- 6 digit Hexadecimal string value
